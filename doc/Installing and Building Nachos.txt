Installing and Building Nachos
On the ITS Solaris SPARC machine 
(These instructions assume that you are using i5.nyu.edu)
Create a directory in which to unpack the code directory. I suggest V22.0202 or v22.0202 in your home directory to make it easy for us to find. 

mkdir dirname
cd dirname
tar xf /home1/v/vk18/OS/code-solaris.tar 
cd nachos-3.4/code
make 

Verify before you do any of the above that GNU make (make on i5.nyu.edu), and gcc are in your path, and that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable includes /usr/local/lib. Expect the first Nachos build to take a few minutes.  

On a Linux/x86 machine:
Download the version of the Nachos source that has been customized for Linux/x86 (code-linux.tar.gz) from the Nachos Resources page(http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring05/V22.0202-001/nachos-resources.htm). Unpack this file into a directory on your machine:

mkdir dirname
cd dirname
tar zxf <path to downloaded code-linux.tar.gz>
cd nachos-3.4/code
make

You should end up with two subdirectories: nachos-3.4 and gnu-decstation-ultrix. Please do not delete any of the files (or otherwise modify the structure) in the gnu-decstation-ultrix subdirectory. These files are required to allow you to compile user-level programs for Nachos, which rely on a MIPS cross-compiler (see the Nachos Project Guide for additional details).

Verify before you do any of the above that GNU make (make on Linux), and gcc are in your path, and that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable includes /usr/local/lib. Expect the first Nachos build to take a few minutes. 

Adding New Files to the Nachos build
Modify Makefile.common in the code directory, supplementing THREAD_*, USERPROG_*, ... lists. Use tabs, not spaces! Remember to do a 'make depend' in the threads directory.
